REM Explanation of the pause command:
REM The pause command is used to keep the Command Prompt window open after the batch file has finished executing.
REM This way, you can see the output and any messages displayed, rather than the window closing immediately.
REM When pause is encountered, it displays the message "Press any key to continue . . ." and waits for you to press a key before proceeding, ensuring you can review the scriptâ€™s output.
